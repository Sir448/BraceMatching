# BraceMatching
Brace Matching like a code editor in any text field

Characters that would want to have brace matching:
`
'
"
(
[
{
<
: (for emotes, off by default)

Currently not work:
On Reddit, if you add braces to a comment you are making, if the braces are the last thing you add, when you submit the comment, they will not be in the comment. If you unfocus from the textfield, the braces will inconsistently stay or disappear, but submitting the comment will never have the braces. If you edit the comment after, the braces will stay when submitted. (It used to disappear when editing. I have not changed anything but the problem is gone)
I don't think there is a way to fix it. I seems to be a security feature.
